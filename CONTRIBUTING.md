# Contribution Guidelines


1. Contribute meaningly:
  If you are new to coding or new to using Git/Github that's totally fine! Submitting simple pull requests still counts, but don't just add one letter to a string and submit a request.

2. Don't Spam:
  In general and for Hacktoberfest spammy pull requests will be rejected and only cause unncessary work for maintainers.

3. Have fun!
   Feel free to expand on the project, add variations, changes, bug fixes, etc. but most of all have fun!
